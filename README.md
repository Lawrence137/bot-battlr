# Bot Battlr 

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a

list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

# Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.


- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.


- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.


- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
